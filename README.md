# Inventory Dashboard
This is a web based app


## Summary
This system aims to manage an order of goods by a client from a stationary device or from a mobile device, provide the order details to the business and allow it to manage that order.
The idea is to have every business can register and get a dashboard where he can upload his products into a list of products.

### IT works like this- 
1. user enters the app, decides which screen he wants to be presented on this device, and that will be the screen shown on the device.

2. Responsivity needs to fit tablet (for user and client use) and web for me.

3. Owner dashboard basically collects the info from all the users into a table, and can define what months it wants to look at

### Main features:
* Real time updating screens
